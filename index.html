This future goal created present constraints: it meant that I could not advocate for vengeance, I had to negotiate with my former jailers, and I had to publicly forgive those who had committed terrible acts.

It was a choice between being a good employee and being a good person.",
                    assembly_history: "My assembly history is that of a classic 'systems thinker.' I have a degree in electrical and computer engineering and an MBA from Harvard. I've spent my career working at tech companies like Google, Pinterest, and Yelp, always focused on algorithmic product design. I was not a political activist; I was a technical problem-solver. But this background gave me the unique ability to understand the complex systems at the heart of Facebook's problems. My decision to act was not based on ideology, but on a data-driven conclusion that the system was broken and causing significant harm.",
                    future_pull: "My 'future pull' is a vision of a safer, more responsible, and more transparent digital world. I am not trying to destroy Facebook; I am trying to create a future where social media platforms are subject to the same kind of regulation and oversight as other industries that can cause public harm, like cars or tobacco. This vision requires the creation of new institutions, like a federal agency dedicated to digital products. Every document I released and every testimony I give is aimed at building the public and political will to create that future."

                    beliefs: "I believe that the first duty of an engineer is to the truth and to public safety, above any loyalty to their employer. My core belief is that engineering is not just a technical profession; it is a moral one. We are entrusted with the power to create things that can have life-or-death consequences, and that trust requires an absolute commitment to integrity. Data is not just numbers; it is a representation of a physical reality that does not care about launch schedules or political pressure.",
                    rules: "My primary rule was to follow the data, wherever it led. The data on the O-rings in cold weather was clear and unambiguous: it was unsafe to launch. A second rule is to communicate risks clearly and forcefully up the chain of command. I did not just raise a concern; I wrote a detailed memo, I presented my findings, I argued with my managers. I followed every procedure available to me to make the danger known.",
                    ontology: "In an engineering context, the most real things are not managers' opinions or marketing deadlines; the most real things are the laws of physics and the material properties of your components. The foam on the external tank, the O-rings on the solid rocket boosters‚Äîthese were not abstract concepts. They were physical objects with known failure points. The disaster happened because the reality of the engineering data was ignored in favor of the socially constructed reality of a launch schedule.",
                    authenticity: "Authenticity for me was about upholding my identity as an engineer. An engineer who ignores data is not an engineer; they are a bureaucrat. When my managers decided to overrule the engineers and approve the launch, they created a situation where I could no longer be authentic to my professional identity and remain silent. My decision to testify before the presidential commission was not a choice to become a whistleblower; it was a choice to remain an engineer. It was the only way to be true to the oath I had taken.",
                    assembly_history: "My assembly history was that of a working engineer. I had spent decades in the aerospace industry, working on complex projects from aircraft brakes to the lunar module. I was trained to identify risks, to test components, and to trust the data. I was a company man, a team player. But my entire career was built on a foundation of scientific and technical rationality. The Challenger situation was a crisis because it forced a conflict between my identity as a loyal employee and my more fundamental identity as a rational engineer. The engineer won.",
                    future_pull: "My 'future pull' became the mission to educate future engineers about the importance of ethical responsibility. After the disaster, I traveled the country, speaking at universities about my experience. I was not trying to become famous; I was trying to create a future where no engineer would ever have to go through what I went through. My goal was to reinforce the professional norms and ethical standards of my profession, to ensure that the next generation of engineers would have the courage and the institutional support to speak up when they see something that is unsafe. My legacy is not the disaster, but the lessons we learned from it."
